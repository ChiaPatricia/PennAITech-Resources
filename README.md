The audience consists of decision-makers in the public and private sectors, advisors and staff to those decision-makers, program administrators, researchers, students, and the interested public. Articles in each issue are informed, to the point, and provocative. Authors are drawn from the leadership ranks of the policy, practice, and research communities. In the Public Policy & Aging Report, these authors are afforded the opportunity to engage readers in a more timely and pressing manner than is afforded through most other publication formats.
